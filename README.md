# Chatbot and LLM Development Project

### 📢 Overview
This project showcases the development and deployment of an **AI-powered Chatbot** leveraging state-of-the-art **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. Built using **Hugging Face**, **OpenOrca datasets**, and **Gradio**, the chatbot offers advanced conversational abilities for diverse applications, including customer support automation and virtual assistance.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Advanced Chatbot Development:** Built using Hugging Face models, leveraging the **OpenOrca** dataset for enhanced conversational AI.  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilized tokenization, attention mechanisms, and fine-tuning techniques to optimize chatbot responses.  
- **Performance Optimization:** Applied techniques like response validation and inference optimization for faster and accurate results.  
- **Deployment on Cloud Platforms:**  
   - 🚀 **Hugging Face Spaces** for web-based interaction via **Gradio**.  
   - ☁️ **AWS ECS** for scalable production deployment using **Docker** and **Terraform**.
